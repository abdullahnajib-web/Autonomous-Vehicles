# Autonomous Vehicles

This program simulates a smart car system equipped with ESP32CAM and ESP32 microcontrollers, powered by TensorFlow and Keras deep learning frameworks. It captures images and video from its environment using ESP32CAM and processes them in real-time to achieve various tasks.

- Facial Recognition: The ESP32CAM captures images, which are then processed by a facial recognition model running on ESP32. This allows the car to identify individuals and make personalized decisions.
- Object Detection: Images captured by ESP32CAM are analyzed by an object detection model running on ESP32. This model detects objects in the surroundings, such as vehicles or pedestrians, and provides information for further action.
- Traffic Sign Recognition: ESP32CAM is responsible for capturing images of traffic signs in the vicinity. These images are processed by a traffic sign recognition model running on ESP32. Information about traffic signs is relayed to the car's control system.
- Line Tracking: ESP32CAM captures images of road lines or tracks, which are then analyzed by a line tracking model running on ESP32. The model provides guidance on how to follow the road lines.

This integrated system showcases the potential of combining computer vision, machine learning with TensorFlow and Keras, and hardware control using ESP32 and ESP32CAM for smart car applications.
